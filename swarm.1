.SH DESCRIPTION
Environmental or clinical molecular studies generate large volumes of
amplicons (e.g. SSU-rRNA sequences) that need to be clustered into
molecular operational taxonomic units. Traditional clustering methods
are based on greedy, input-order dependent algorithms, with arbitrary
selection of global cluster size and cluster centroids. To address
that problem, we developed \fBswarm\fR, a fast and robust method that
recursively groups amplicons with \fId\fR or less
differences. \fBswarm\fR produces stable clusters (or "swarms"), free
from centroid selection induced input-order dependency.
.PP
Exact clustering is impractical on large data sets when using a naïve
all-vs-all approach (i.e. a 2-combination without repetitions), as it
implies unrealistic numbers of pairwise comparisons. \fBswarm\fR is
based on a maximum number of differences, and focuses only on close
relationships. An efficient \fIk\fR-mer-based filtering and an astute
use of comparisons results obtained during the process allows to avoid
most of the amplicon comparisons needed in a naïve approach. To speed
up the remaining amplicon comparisons, \fBswarm\fR implements an
extremely fast Needleman-Wunsch algorithm making use of the Streaming
SIMD Extensions (SSE2) of modern x86-64 CPUs. If SSE2 instructions are
not available, \fBswarm\fR exits with an error message.
.PP
\fBswarm\fR reads the named input \fIfilename\fR, a fasta file of
nucleotide amplicons. The amplicon identifier is defined as the string
comprised between the ">" symbol and the first space or the end of the
line, whichever comes first. As \fBswarm\fR outputs lists of amplicon
identifiers, amplicon identifiers must be unique to avoid ambiguity;
swarm exits with an error message if identifiers are not unique. If
amplicon identifiers end with a "_" followed by a number, that number
is used as the amplicon copy number in the statistics output file. The
amplicon sequence is defined as a string of [acgt] or [acgu] symbols
(case insensitive), starting after the end of the identifier line and
ending before the next identifier line or the file end; \fBswarm\fR
exits with an error message if any other symbol is present. Default is
to read from standard input if no file is named, or if the file name
is "-".
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Options
\fBswarm\fR recognizes the following command-line options:
.RS
.TP 9
.BI -d\fP,\fB\ --differences\~ "positive integer"
maximum number of differences allowed between two amplicons, meaning
that two amplicons will be grouped if they have \fIinteger\fR (or
less) differences. This is \fBswarm\fR's most important parameter. The
number of differences is calculated as the number of mismatches
(substitutions, insertions or deletions) between the two amplicons
once the optimal pairwise global alignment has been found (see
"advanced options" for parameters influencing the pairwise
alignment). Any \fIinteger\fR between 1 and 256 can be used, but
aligning two very distant amplicons is difficult and results should be
considered with caution. Default number of differences is 1.
.TP
.B -h\fP,\fB\ --help
display this help and exit.
.TP
.BI -o\fP,\fB\ --output-file \0filename
output result to \fIfilename\fR. Result is a list of swarms, one swarm
per line. A swarm is a list of amplicon identifiers separated by
spaces. Default is to write to standard output.
.TP
.BI -s\fP,\fB\ --statistics-file \0filename
output statistics to the specified file. Default is not to output
statistics.  The file is a tab-separated table with one swarm per row
and seven columns of information: number of unique amplicons in the
swarm, total copy number of amplicons in the swarm, identifier of the
initial seed, initial seed copy number (if applicable), number of
singletons (amplicons with a copy number of 1), maximum number of
generations (i.e. numbers of iterations before the swarm reached its
natural limits), and the maximum radius of the swarm (i.e. number of
differences between the seed and the furthermost amplicon in the
swarm).
.TP
.BI -t\fP,\fB\ --threads\~ "positive integer"
number of computation threads to use. The number of threads should be
lesser or equal to the number of available CPU cores. Default number
of threads is 1.
.TP
.BI -u\fP,\fB\ --uclust-file \0filename
output results in uclust-like file format to the specified file. That
option does not modify swarm default output format.
.TP
.B -v\fP,\fB\ --version
output version information and exit.
.LP
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SS Advanced options
\fBswarm\fR recognizes advanced command-line options modifying the
pairwise global alignment scoring parameters:
.RS
.TP 9
.BI -m\fP,\fB\ --match-reward\~ "positive integer"
reward for a nucleotide match. Default is 5.
.TP
.BI -p\fP,\fB\ --mismatch-penalty\~ "positive integer"
penalty for a nucleotide mismatch. Default is 4.
.TP
.BI -g\fP,\fB\ --gap-opening-penalty\~ "positive integer"
gap open penalty. Default is 12.
.TP
.BI -e\fP,\fB\ --gap-extension-penalty\~ "positive integer"
gap extension penalty. Default is 4.
.LP
As \fBswarm\fR focuses on close relationships, final results are
resilient to model parameters modifications. Modifying model
parameters only impacts swarms with a large number of subseed levels,
or analysis using a high number of differences.
.\" classic parameters are +5/-4/-12/-1
.\" ============================================================================
.SH EXAMPLES
.B swarm
-t 4 -o
.I myfile.swarms myfile.fasta
.br
Divide the data set \fImyfile.fasta\fR into swarms with the finest
resolution possible (1 difference) using 4 computation threads, and
write the results in the file \fImyfile.swarms\fR.
.PP
zcat file.fas.gz | \fBswarm\fR | awk "{print NF}" | sort -n | uniq -c
.br
Use swarm in a pipeline to read a compressed fasta file and to get its
swarm size profile (with default parameters).

.SH VERSION HISTORY
New features and important modifications of \fBswarm\fR:
.RS
.TP
.BR v1.2\~ "released May 16, 2013"
Version 1.2 greatly improves speed by using a \fIk\fR-mer-based
filtering. For each amplicon, the presence-absence of all possible
5-mers is computed and recorded in a 1024-bits vector. Vector
comparisons are extremely fast and drastically reduce the number of
costly pairwise alignments performed by swarm. While remaining exact,
swarm 1.2 can be more than 100-times faster than swarm 1.1, when using
a single thread with a large set of sequences. The minor version
1.1.1, published just before, adds compatibility with Apple computers,
and corrects an issue in the pairwise global alignment step that could
lead to sub-optimal alignments.
.TP
.BR v1.1\~ "released February 26, 2013"
Version 1.1 introduces two new important options: the possibility to
output swarming results using the uclust output format, and the
possibility to output detailed statistics on each swarms. Swarm 1.1 is
also faster: new filterings based on pairwise amplicon sequence
lengths and composition comparisons reduce the number of pairwise
alignments needed and speed up the swarming.
